<h3><a name="ROBIN_HOOD" id="ROBIN_HOOD"></a>ROBIN HOOD.</h3>


<p>There is no one of the royal heroes of England
that enjoys a more enviable reputation than
the bold outlaw of Barnsdale and Sherwood.
His chance for a substantial immortality is at least
as good as that of stout Lion Heart, wild Prince
Hal, or merry Charles. His fame began with
the yeomanry full five hundred years ago, was
constantly increasing for two or three centuries,
has extended to all classes of society, and, with
some changes of aspect, is as great as ever. Bishops
sheriffs, and game-keepers, the only enemies
he ever had, have relinquished their ancient
grudges, and Englishmen would be almost as
loath to surrender his exploits as any part of the
national glory. His free life in the woods, his unerring
eye and strong arm, his open hand and love
of fair-play, his never-forgotten courtesy, his respect
for women and devotion to Mary, form a
picture eminently healthful and agreeable to the
imagination, and commend him to the hearty favor
of all genial minds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>

<p>But securely established as Robin Hood is in
popular esteem, his historical position is by no
means well ascertained, and his actual existence
has been a subject of shrewd doubt and discussion.
"A tale of Robin Hood"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> is an old
proverb for the idlest of stories, yet all the
materials at our command for making up an
opinion on these questions are precisely of this
description. They consist, that is to say, in a
few ballads of unknown antiquity. These ballads,
or others like them, are clearly the authority upon
which the statements of the earlier chroniclers
who take notice of Robin Hood are founded.
They are also, to all appearances, the original
source of the numerous and widespread traditions
concerning him; which, unless the contrary
can be shown, must be regarded, after what we
have observed in similar cases, as having been
suggested by the very legends to which, in the
vulgar belief, they afford an irresistible confirmation.</p>

<p>Various periods, ranging from the time of Richard
the First to near the end of the reign of Edward
the Second, have been selected by different
writers as the age of Robin Hood; but (excepting
always the most ancient ballads, which may possibly
be placed within these limits) no mention what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>ever
is made of him in literature before the latter
half of the reign of Edward the Third. "Rhymes
of Robin Hood"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> are then spoken of by the author
of <i>Piers Ploughman</i>, (assigned to about 1362,) as
better known to idle fellows than pious songs, and
from the manner of the allusion it is a just inference
that such rhymes were at that time no
novelties. The next notice is in Wyntown's
Scottish Chronicle, written about 1420, where the
following lines occur&mdash;without any connection, and
in the form of an entry&mdash;under the year 1283.</p>

<p>At last we encounter Robin Hood in what may
be called history; first of all in a passage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
<i>Scotichronicon</i>, often quoted, and highly curious as
containing the earliest theory upon this subject.
The <i>Scotichronicon</i> was written partly by Fordun,
canon of Aberdeen, between 1377 and 1384,
and partly by his pupil Bower, abbot of St.
Columba, about 1450. Fordun has the character
of a man of judgment and research, and any
statement or opinion delivered by him would be
entitled to respect. Of Bower, not so much can
be said. He largely interpolated the work of his
master, and sometimes with the absurdest fictions.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
<i>Among his interpolations</i>,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and forming, it is important
to observe, <i>no part of the original text</i>, is
a passage translated as follows.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It is inserted
immediately after Fordun's account of the defeat
of Simon de Montfort, and the punishments
inflicted on his adherents.</p>

<p>"At this time, (<i>sc.</i> 1266,) from the number of
those who had been deprived of their estates, arose
the celebrated bandit Robert Hood (with Little
John and their accomplices) whose achievements
the foolish vulgar delight to celebrate in comedies
and tragedies, while the ballads upon his adventures
sung by the jesters and minstrels are preferred
to all others.</p>

<p>"Some things to his honor are also related,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
as appears from this. Once on a time, when,
having incurred the anger of the king and the
prince, he could hear mass nowhere but in Barnsdale,
while he was devoutly occupied with the
service, (for this was his wont, nor would he ever
suffer it to be interrupted for the most pressing
occasion,) he was surprised by a certain sheriff
and officers of the king, who had often troubled
him before, in the secret place in the woods where
he was engaged in worship as aforesaid. Some
of his men, who had taken the alarm, came to him
and begged him to fly with all speed. This, out
of reverence for the host, which he was then most
devoutly adoring, he positively refused to do. But
while the rest of his followers were trembling for
their lives, Robert, confiding in him whom he
worshipped, fell on his enemies with a few who
chanced to be with him, and easily got the better
of them; and having enriched himself with their
plunder and ransom, he was led from that time
forth to hold ministers of the church and masses
in greater veneration than ever, mindful of the
common saying that</p>

<p class="center">
"God hears the man who often hears the mass."
</p>

<p>In another place Bower writes to the same
effect: "In this year (1266) the dispossessed
barons of England and the royalists were engaged
in fierce hostilities. Among the former, Roger
Mortimer occupied the Welsh marches, and John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
Daynil the Isle of Ely. Robert Hood was now
living in outlawry among the woodland copses and
thickets."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Mair, a Scottish writer of the first quarter of
the 16th century, the next historian who takes
cognizance of our hero, and the only other that
requires any attention, has a passage which may
be considered in connection with the foregoing.
In his <i>Historia Majoris Brittaniæ</i>, he remarks,
under the reign of Richard the First: "About
this time [1189-99], as I conjecture, the notorious
robbers Robert Hood of England and Little John
lurked in the woods, spoiling the goods only of
rich men. They slew nobody but those who attacked
them, or offered resistance in defence of
their property. Robert maintained by his plunder
a hundred archers, so skilful in fight that
four hundred brave men feared to attack them.
He suffered no woman to be maltreated, and
never robbed the poor, but assisted them abundantly
with the wealth which he took from
abbots."</p>

<p>It appears then that contemporaneous history
is absolutely silent concerning Robin Hood; that,
excepting the casual allusion in <i>Piers Ploughman</i>,
he is first mentioned by a rhyming chronicler, who
wrote one hundred years after the latest date at
which he can possibly be supposed to have lived,
and then by two prose chroniclers, who wrote about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
one hundred and twenty-five years and two hundred
years respectively after that date; and it is
further manifest that all three of these chroniclers
had no other authority for their statements than
traditional tales similar to those which have
come down to our day.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> When, therefore, Thierry,
relying upon these chronicles and kindred popular
legends, unhesitatingly adopts the conjecture of
Mair, and describes Robin Hood as the hero of the
Saxon serfs, the chief of a troop of Saxon banditti
that continued, even to the reign of Coeur de Lion,
a determined resistance against the Norman invaders,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
and when another able and plausible writer
accepts and maintains, with equal confidence, the
hypothesis of Bower, and exhibits the renowned
outlaw as an adherent of Simon de Montfort, who,
after the fatal battle of Evesham, kept up a vigorous
guerilla warfare against the officers of the
tyrant Henry the Third, and of his successor,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> we
must regard these representations which were
conjectural three or four centuries ago, as conjec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>tures
still, and even as arbitrary conjectures, unless
one or the other can be proved from the only <i>authorities</i>
we have, the ballads, to have a peculiar
intrinsic probability. That neither of them possesses
this intrinsic probability may easily be
shown, but first it will be advisable to notice
another theory, which is more plausibly founded
on internal evidence, and claims to be confirmed
by documents of unimpeachable validity.</p>

<p>This theory has been propounded by the Rev.
John Hunter, in one of his <i>Critical and Historical
Tracts</i>.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Mr. Hunter admits that Robin Hood
"lives only as a hero of song;" that he is not
found in authentic contemporary chronicles; and
that, when we find him mentioned in history, "the
information was derived from the ballads, and is
not independent of them or correlative with them."
While making these admissions, he accords a considerable
degree of credibility to the ballads, and
particularly to the <i>Lytell Geste</i>, the last two <i>fits</i>
of which he regards as giving a tolerably accurate
account of real occurrences.</p>

<p>In this part of the story, King Edward is represented
as coming to Nottingham to take Robin
Hood. He traverses Lancashire and a part of
Yorkshire, and finds his forests nearly stripped of
their deer, but can get no trace of the author of
these extensive depredations. At last, by the
advice of one of his foresters, assuming with sev<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>eral
of his knights the dress of a monk, he proceeds
from Nottingham to Sherwood, and there
soon encounters the object of his search. He
submits to plunder as a matter of course, and then
announces himself as a messenger sent to invite
Robin Hood to the royal presence. The outlaw
receives this message with great respect. There
is no man in the world, he says, whom he loves
so much as his king. The monk is invited to remain
and dine; and after the repast, an exhibition
of archery is ordered, in which a bad shot is to be
punished by a buffet from the hand of the chieftain.
Robin having once failed of the mark requests
the monk to administer the penalty. He
receives a staggering blow, which rouses his suspicions,
recognizes the king on an attentive consideration
of his countenance, entreats grace for
himself and his followers, and is freely pardoned
on condition that he and they shall enter into
the king's service. To this he agrees, and for
fifteen months resides at court. At the end
of this time he has lost all his followers but two,
and spent all his money, and feels that he shall
pine to death with sorrow in such a life. He
returns accordingly to the green wood, collects his
old followers around him, and for twenty-two years
maintains his independence in defiance of the
power of Edward.</p>

<p>Without asserting the literal verity of all the
particulars of this narrative, Mr. Hunter attempts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
to show that it contains a substratum of fact.
Edward the First, he informs us, was never in
Lancashire after he became king, and if Edward
the Third was ever there at all, it was not in the
early years of his reign. But Edward the Second
did make one single progress in Lancashire,
and this in the year 1323. During this progress
the king spent some time at Nottingham,
and took particular note of the condition of his
forests, and among these of the forest of Sherwood.
Supposing now that the incidents detailed
in the <i>Lytell Geste</i> really took place at this time,
Robin Hood must have entered into the royal service
before the end of the year 1323. It is a singular,
and in the opinion of Mr. Hunter a very
pregnant coincidence, that, in certain Exchequer
documents containing accounts of expenses in the
king's household, the name of Robyn Hode (or
Robert Hood) is found several times, beginning
with the 24th of March, 1324, among the "porters
of the chamber" of the king. He received,
with Simon Hood and others, the wages of three
pence a day. In August of the following year
Robin Hood suffers deduction from his pay for
non-attendance, his absences grow frequent, and,
on the 22d of November, he is discharged with a
present of five shillings, "<i>poar cas qil ne poait
pluis travailler</i>".<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>It remains still for Mr. Hunter to account for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
existence of a band of seven score of outlaws in
the reign of Edward the Second, in or about
Yorkshire. The stormy and troublous reigns of
the Plantagenets make this a matter of no difficulty.
Running his finger down the long list of
rebellions and commotions, he finds that early in
1322 England was convulsed by the insurrection
of Thomas Earl of Lancaster, the king's near
relation, supported by many powerful noblemen.
The Earl's chief seat was the castle of Pontefract,
in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He is said to
have been popular, and it would be a fair inference
that many of his troops were raised in this part of
England. King Edward easily got the better of
the rebels and took exemplary vengeance upon
them. Many of the leaders were at once put to
death, and the lives of all their partisans were in
danger. Is it impossible then, asks Mr. Hunter,
that some who had been in the army of the Earl,
secreted themselves in the woods and turned their
skill in archery against the king's subjects or the
king's deer; "that these were the men who for
so long a time haunted Barnsdale and Sherwood,
and that Robin Hood was one of them, a chief
amongst them, being really of a rank originally
somewhat superior to the rest?"</p>

<p>We have then three different hypotheses concerning
Robin Hood, one placing him in the reign of
Richard the First, another in that of Henry the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
Third, and the last under Edward the Second, and
all describing him as a political foe to the established
government. To all of these hypotheses there
are two very obvious and decisive objections. The
first is that Robin Hood, as already remarked, is
not so much as named in contemporary history.
Whether as the unsubdued leader of the Saxon
peasantry, or insurgent against the tyranny of
Henry or Edward, it is inconceivable that we
should not hear something of him from the
chroniclers. If, as Thierry says, "he had chosen
Hereward for his model," it is unexplained and
inexplicable why his historical fate has been so
different from that of Hereward. The hero of the
Camp of Refuge fills an ample place in the annals
of his day; his achievements are also handed down
in a prose romance which presents many points
of resemblance to the ballads of Robin Hood. It
would have been no wonder if the vulgar legends
about Hereward had utterly perished, but it is
altogether anomalous<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> that a popular champion
who attained so extraordinary a notoriety in song,
a man living from one hundred to two hundred
and fifty years later than Hereward, should be
passed over without one word of notice from any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
authoritative historian.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> That this would not be
so, we are most fortunately able to demonstrate
by reference to a real case which furnishes a
singularly exact parallel to the present, that of
the famous outlaw, Adam Gordon. In the year
1267, says the continuator of Matthew Paris, a
soldier by the name of Adam Gordon, who had
lost his estates with other adherents of Simon de
Montfort, and refused to seek the mercy of the
king, established himself with others in like circumstances
near a woody and tortuous road between
the village of Wilton and the castle of
Farnham, from which position he made forays into
the country round about, directing his attacks especially
against those who were of the king's party.
Prince Edward had heard much of the prowess
and honorable character of this man, and desired to
have some personal knowledge of him. He succeeded
in surprising Gordon with a superior
force, and engaged him in single combat, forbidding
any of his own followers to interfere. They
fought a long time, and the prince was so filled
with admiration of the courage and spirit of his
antagonist that he promised him life and fortune on
condition of his surrendering. To these terms Gor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>don
acceded, his estates were restored, and Edward
found him ever after an attached and faithful
servant.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The story is romantic, and yet Adam
Gordon was not made the subject of ballads.
<i>Caruit vate sacro.</i> The contemporary historians,
however, all have a paragraph for him.
He is celebrated by Wikes, the Chronicle of
Dunstaple, the Waverley Annals, and we know
not where else besides.</p>

<p>But these theories are open to an objection
stronger even than the silence of history. They
are contradicted by the spirit of the ballads.
No line of these songs breathes political animosity.
There is no suggestion or reminiscence
of wrong, from invading Norman, or from the
established sovereign. On the contrary, Robin
loved no man in the world so well as his king.
What the tone of these ballads would have been,
had Robin Hood been any sort of partisan, we
may judge from the mournful and indignant
strains which were poured out on the fall of De
Montfort. We should have heard of the fatal
field of Hastings, of the perfidy of Henry, of the
sanguinary revenge of Edward, and not of
matches at archery and encounters at quarter-staff,
the plundering of rich abbots, and squabbles
with the sheriff. The Robin Hood of our ballads
is neither patriot under ban, nor proscribed rebel.
An outlaw indeed he is, but an "outlaw for veny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>son,"
like Adam Bell, and one who superadds to
deer-stealing the irregularity of a genteel highway
robbery.</p>

<p>Thus much of these conjectures in general. To
recur to the particular evidence by which Mr. Hunter's
theory is supported, this consists principally
in the name of Robin Hood being found among
the king's servants shortly after Edward II. returned
from his visit to the north of his dominions.
But the value of this coincidence depends entirely
upon the rarity of the name.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Now Hood, as
Mr. Hunter himself remarks, is a well-established
hereditary name in the reigns of the Edwards.
We find it very frequently in the indexes to the
Record Publications, and this although it does not
belong to the higher class of people. That Robert
was an ordinary Christian name requires no proof,
and if it was, the combination of Robert Hood must
have been frequent also. We have taken no extraordinary
pains to hunt up this combination, for
really the matter is altogether too trivial to justify
the expense of time; but since to some minds
much may depend on the coincidence in question,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
we will cite several Robin Hoods in the reign of
the Edwards.</p>

<p>28th Ed. I. Robert Hood, a citizen of London,
says Mr. Hunter, supplied the king's household
with beer.</p>

<p>30th Ed. I. Robert Hood is sued for three
acres of pasture land in Throckley, Northumberland.
(<i>Rot. Orig. Abbrev.</i>)</p>

<p>7th Ed. II. Robert Hood is surety for a
burgess returned for Lostwithiel, Cornwall. (<i>Parliamentary
Writs.</i>)</p>

<p>9th Ed. II. Robert Hood is a citizen of Wakefield,
Yorkshire, whom Mr. Hunter (p. 47) "may
be justly charged with carrying supposition too
far" by striving to identify with Robin the porter.</p>

<p>10th Ed. III. A Robert Hood, of Howden,
York, is mentioned in the <i>Calendarium Rot.
Patent</i>.</p>

<p>Adding the Robin Hood of the 17th Ed. II.
we have six persons of that name mentioned
within a period of less than forty years, and this
circumstance does not dispose us to receive with
great favor any argument that may be founded
upon one individual case of its occurrence. But
there is no end to the absurdities which flow
from this supposition. We are to believe that the
weak and timid prince that had severely punished
his kinsman and his nobles, freely pardoned a
yeoman, who, after serving with the rebels, had for
twenty months made free with the king's deer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
and robbed on the highway, and not only pardoned
him, but received him into service <i>near his person</i>.
We are further to believe that the man who had
led so daring and jovial a life, and had so generously
dispensed the pillage of opulent monks, willingly
entered into this service, doffed his Lincoln
green for the Plantagenet plush, and <i>consented</i> to
be enrolled among royal flunkies for three pence a
day. And again, admitting all this, we are finally
obliged by Mr. Hunter's document to concede that
the stalwart archer (who, according to the ballad,
maintained himself two and twenty years in the
wood) was worn out by his duties as "proud portèr"
in less than two years, and was discharged a
superannuated lackey, with five shillings in his
pocket, "<i>poar cas qil ne poait pluis travailler</i>."</p>

<p>To those who are well acquainted with ancient
popular poetry, the adventure of King Edward
and Robin Hood, will seem the least eligible portion
of this circle of story for the foundation of
an historical theory. The ballad of King Edward
and Robin Hood is but one version of an
extremely multiform legend, of which the tales of
<i>King Edward and the Shepherd</i> and <i>King Edward
and the Hermit</i> are other specimens; and any
one who will take the trouble to examine will be
convinced that all these stories are one and the
same thing, the personages being varied for the
sake of novelty, and the name of a recent or of the
reigning monarch substituted in successive ages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
for that of a predecessor. (See <i>King Edward
the Fourth and the Tanner of Tamworth</i>.)</p>

<p>Rejecting, then, as nugatory every attempt to
assign Robin Hood a definite position in history,
what view shall we adopt? Are all these traditions
absolute fictions, and is he himself a pure
creation of the imagination? Might not the ballads
under consideration have a basis in the exploits
of a real person, living in the forests, <i>somewhere</i>
and at <i>some time</i>? Or, denying individual existence
to Robin Hood, and particular truth to the
adventures ascribed to him, may we not regard
him as <i>the ideal of the outlaw class</i>, a class so
numerous in all the countries of Europe in the
middle ages? We are perfectly contented to form
no opinion upon the subject; but if compelled to
express one, we should say that this last supposition
(which is no novelty) possessed decidedly
more likelihood than any other. Its plausibility
will be confirmed by attending to the apparent signification
of the name Robin Hood. The natural
refuge and stronghold of the outlaw was the woods.
Hence he is termed by Latin writers <i>silvaticus</i>, by
the Normans <i>forestier</i>. The Anglo-Saxon robber
or highwayman is called a wood-rover, <i>wealdgenga</i>,
and the Norse word for outlaw is exactly equivalent.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
It has been often suggested that Robin Hood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
is a corruption, or dialectic form, of Robin of the
Wood, and when we remember that <i>wood</i> is pronounced
<i>hood</i> in some parts of England,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> (as
<i>whoop</i> is pronounced <i>hoop</i> everywhere,) and that
the outlaw bears in so many languages a name
descriptive of his habitation, this notion will not
seem an idle fancy.</p>

<p>Various circumstances, however, have disposed
writers of learning to look further for a solution
of the question before us. Mr. Wright propounds
an hypothesis that Robin Hood was "one among
the personages of the early mythology of the
Teutonic peoples;" and a German scholar,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
exceedingly interesting article which throws much
light on the history of English sports, has endeavored
to show specifically that he is in name
and substance one with the god Woden. The
arguments by which these views are supported,
though in their present shape very far from convincing,
are entitled to a respectful consideration.</p>

<p>The most important of these arguments are
those which are based on the peculiar connection
between Robin Hood and the month of May.
Mr. Wright has justly remarked, that either an
express mention of this month, or a vivid description
of the season, in the older ballads, shows that
the feats of the hero were generally performed
during this part of the year. Thus, the adventure
of <i>Robin Hood and the Monk</i> befell on "a morning
of May." <i>Robin Hood and the Potter</i>, and <i>Robin
Hood and Guy of Gisborne</i> begin, like <i>Robin Hood
and the Monk</i>, with a description of the season
when leaves are long, blossoms are shooting, and
the small birds are singing, and this season, though
called summer, is at the same time spoken of as
May in <i>Robin Hood and the Monk</i>, which, from
the description there given, it needs must be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>
The liberation of Cloudesly by Adam Bel and
Clym of the Clough is also achieved "on a merry
morning of May."</p>

<p>Robin Hood is moreover intimately associated
with the month of May through the games which
were celebrated at that time of the year. The
history of these games is unfortunately very defective,
and hardly extends beyond the beginning
of the 16th century. By that time their primitive
character seems to have been corrupted, or at
least their significance was so far forgotten, that
distinct pastimes and ceremonials were capriciously
intermixed. At the beginning of the 16th century
the May sports in vogue were, besides a
contest of archery, four <i>pageants</i>,&mdash;the Kingham,
or election of a Lord and Lady of the May, otherwise
called Summer King and Queen, the Morris
Dance, the Hobby Horse, and the "Robin Hood."
Though these pageants were diverse in their origin,
they had, at the epoch of which we write, begun to
be confounded; and the Morris exhibited a tendency
to absorb and blend them all, as, from its
character, being a procession interspersed with
dancing, it easily might do. We shall hardly find
the Morris pure and simple in the English May-game;
but from a comparison of the two earliest
representations which we have of this sport, the
Flemish print given by Douce in his <i>Illustrations
of Shakespeare</i>, and Tollett's celebrated painted
window, (described in Johnson and Steevens's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>
<i>Shakespeare</i>,) we may form an idea of what was
essential and what adventitious in the English
spectacle. The Lady is evidently the central personage
in both. She is, we presume, the same as
the Queen of May, who is the oldest of all the
characters in the May games, and the apparent
successor to the Goddess of Spring in the Roman
Floralia. In the English Morris she is called
simply The Lady, or more frequently Maid Marian,
a name which, to our apprehension, means
Lady of the May, and nothing more. A fool and
a taborer seem also to have been indispensable;
but the other dancers had neither names nor peculiar
offices, and were unlimited in number. The
Morris then, though it lost in allegorical significance,
would gain considerably in spirit and
variety by combining with the other shows. Was
it not natural, therefore, and in fact inevitable,
that the old favorites of the populace, Robin Hood,
Friar Tuck, and Little John, should in the course
of time displace three of the anonymous performers
in the show? This they had pretty effectually
done at the beginning of the 16th century, and the
Lady, who had accepted the more precise designation
of Maid Marian, was after that generally
regarded as the consort of Robin Hood, though
she sometimes appeared in the Morris without
him. In like manner, the Hobby Horse was
quite early adopted into the Morris, of which it
formed no original part, and at last even a Dragon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>
was annexed to the company. Under these circumstances
we cannot be surprised to find the
principal performers in the May pageants passing
the one into the other; to find the May King,
whose occupation was gone when the fascinating
outlaw had supplanted him in the favor of the
Lady, assuming the part of the Hobby Horse,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Robin Hood usurping the title of King of the
May,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and the Hobby Horse entering into a
contest with the Dragon, as St. George.</p>

<p>We feel obliged to regard this interchange of
functions among the characters in the English
May pageants as fortuitous, notwithstanding the coincidence
of the May King sometimes appearing
on horseback in Germany, and notwithstanding
our conviction that Kuhn is right in maintaining
that the May King, the Hobby Horse, and
the Dragon-slayer, are symbols of one mythical
idea. This idea we are compelled by want of
space barely to state, with the certainty of doing
injustice to the learning and ingenuity with which
the author has supported his views. Kuhn has
shown it to be extremely probable, first, that the
Christmas games, which both in Germany and
England have a close resemblance to those of
Spring, are to be considered as a prelude to the
May sports, and that they both originally symbol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>ized
the victory of Summer over Winter,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> which,
beginning at the winter solstice, is completed in the
second month of Spring; secondly, that the conquering
Summer is represented by the May King,
or by the Hobby Horse (as also by the Dragon-slayer,
whether St. George, Siegfried, Apollo, or
the Sanskrit Indras); and thirdly, that the Hobby
Horse in particular represents the god Woden,
who, as well as Mars<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> among the Romans, is the
god at once of Spring and of Victory.</p>

<p>The essential point, all this being admitted, is
now to establish the identity of Robin Hood and
the Hobby Horse. This we think we have shown
cannot be done by reasoning founded on the early
history of the games under consideration. Kuhn
relies principally upon two modern accounts of
Christmas pageants. In one of these pageants there
is introduced a man on horseback, who carries in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>
his hands a bow and arrows. The other furnishes
nothing peculiar except a name: the ceremony is
called a <i>hoodening</i>, and the hobby horse a <i>hooden</i>.
In the rider with bow and arrows, Kuhn sees
Robin Hood and the Hobby Horse, and in the
name <i>hooden</i> (which is explained by the authority
he quotes to mean wooden) he discovers a provincial
form of <i>wooden</i> which connects the outlaw
and the divinity.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> It will be generally
agreed that these slender premises are totally inadequate
to support the weighty conclusion that
is rested upon them.</p>

<p>Why the adventures of Robin Hood should be
specially assigned, as they are in the old ballads,
to the month of May, remains unexplained. We
have no exquisite reason to offer, but we may
perhaps find reason good enough in the delicious
stanzas with which some of these ballads begin.</p>

<p>The poetical character of the season affords all the
explanation that is required.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor need the occurrence of exhibitions of archery
and of the Robin Hood plays and pageants, at
this time of the year, occasion any difficulty.
Repeated statutes, from the 13th to the 16th century,
enjoined practice with the bow, and ordered
that the leisure time of holidays should be employed
for this purpose. Under Henry the Eighth
the custom was still kept up, and those who partook
in this exercise often gave it a spirit by assuming
the style and character of Robin Hood and
his associates. In like manner the society of
archers in Elizabeth's time, took the name of
Arthur and his knights: all which was very
natural then and would be now. None of all the
merrymakings in merry England surpassed the
May festival. The return of the sun stimulated
the populace to the accumulation of all sorts of
amusements. In addition to the traditional and
appropriate sports of the season, there were, as
Stowe tells us, divers warlike shows, with good
archers, morris-dancers, and other devices for pastime
all day long, and towards the evening stage-plays
and bonfires in the streets. A Play of
Robin Hood was considered "very proper for a
May-game," but if Robin Hood was peculiarly
prominent in these entertainments, the obvious
reason would appear to be that he was the hero of
that loved green-wood to which all the world
resorted, when the cold obstruction of winter was
broken up, "to do observance for a morn of May."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span></p>

<p>We do not therefore attribute much value to the
theory of Mr. Wright, that the May festival was,
in its earliest form, "a religious celebration,
though, like such festivals in general, it possessed
a double character, that of a religious ceremony,
and of an opportunity for the performance of warlike
games; that, at such festivals, the songs would
take the character of the amusements on the
occasion, and would most likely celebrate warlike
deeds&mdash;perhaps the myths of the patron whom
superstition supposed to preside over them; that,
as the character of the exercises changed, the
attributes of the patron would change also, and he
who was once celebrated as working wonders with
his good axe or his elf-made sword, might afterwards
assume the character of a skilful bowman;
that the scene of his actions would likewise change,
and the person whose weapons were the bane of
dragons and giants, who sought them in the wildernesses
they infested, might become the enemy
only of the sheriff and his officers, under the
'grene-wode lefe.'" It is unnecessary to point out
that the language we have quoted contains, beyond
the statement that warlike exercises were anciently
combined with religious rites, a very slightly
founded surmise, and nothing more.</p>

<p>Another circumstance which weighs much with
Mr. Wright, goes but a very little way with us in
demonstrating the mythological character of Robin
Hood. This is the frequency with which his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>
name is attached to mounds, wells, and stones, such
as in the popular creed are connected with fairies,
dwarfs, or giants. There is scarcely a county in
England which does not possess some monument
of this description. "Cairns on Blackdown
in Somersetshire, and barrows near to Whitby in
Yorkshire and Ludlow in Shropshire, are termed
Robin Hood's pricks or butts; lofty natural
eminences in Gloucestershire and Derbyshire are
Robin Hood's hills; a huge rock near Matlock is
Robin Hood's Tor; ancient boundary stones, as
in Lincolnshire, are Robin Hood's crosses; a presumed
loggan, or rocking-stone, in Yorkshire, is
Robin Hood's penny-stone; a fountain near Nottingham,
another between Doncaster and Wakefield,
and one in Lancashire, are Robin Hood's
wells; a cave in Nottinghamshire is his stable;
a rude natural rock in Hope Dale is his chair; a
chasm at Chatsworth is his leap; Blackstone Edge,
in Lancashire, is his bed."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> In fact, his name bids
fair to overrun every remarkable object of the
sort which has not been already appropriated to
King Arthur or the Devil; with the latter of
whom, at least, it is presumed that, however
ancient, he will not dispute precedence.</p>

<p>"The legends of the peasantry," quoth Mr.
Wright, "are the shadows of a very remote antiquity."
This proposition, thus broadly stated, we
deny. Nothing is more deceptive than popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>
legends; and the "legends," we speak of, if they
are to bear that name, have no claim to antiquity
at all. They do not go beyond the ballads. They
are palpably of subsequent and comparatively recent
origin. It was absolutely impossible that they
should arise while Robin Hood was a living reality
to the people. The archer of Sherwood who could
barely stand King Edward's buffet, and was
felled by the Potter, was no man to be playing
with rocking stones. This trick of naming must
have begun in the decline of his fame, for there
was a time when his popularity drooped, and his
existence was just not doubted; not elaborately
maintained by learned historians, and antiquarians
deeply read in the Public Records. And what
do these names prove? The vulgar passion for
bestowing them is notorious and universal. We
Americans are too young to be well provided with
heroes that might serve this purpose. We have
no imaginative peasantry to invent legends, no
ignorant peasantry to believe them. But we have
the good fortune to possess the Devil in common
with the rest of the world; and we take it upon us
to say, that there is not a mountain district in the
land, which has been opened to summer travellers,
where a "Devil's Bridge," a "Devil's Punch-bowl,"
or some object with the like designation,
will not be pointed out.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>
We have taken no notice of the later fortunes
of Robin Hood in his true and original character
of a hero of romance. Towards the end of the
16th century, Anthony Munday attempted to revive
the decaying popularity of this king of good
fellows, who had won all his honors as a simple
yeoman, by representing him in the play of <i>The
Downfall of Robert Earl of Huntington</i>, as a
nobleman in disguise, outlawed by the machinations
of his steward. This pleasing and successful
drama is Robin's sole patent to that title of
Earl of Huntington, in confirmation of which,
Dr. Stukeley fabricated a pedigree that transcends
even the absurdities of heraldry, and some unknown
forger an epitaph beneath the skill of a
Chatterton. Those who desire a full acquaintance
with the fabulous history of Robin Hood, will seek
it in the well-known volumes of Ritson, or in those
of his recent editor, Gutch, who does not make up
by superior discrimination for his inferiority in
other respects to that industrious antiquary.</p>

<h3><a name="ROBIN_HOOD_AND_THE_POTTER" id="ROBIN_HOOD_AND_THE_POTTER"></a>ROBIN HOOD AND THE POTTER.</h3>


<p>From Ritson's <i>Robin Hood</i>, i. 81. "This curious, and
hitherto unpublished, and even unheard of old piece,"
remarks that editor, "is given from a manuscript among
Bishop More's collections, in the Public Library of the
University of Cambridge (Ee. 4. 35). The writing,
which is evidently that of a vulgar and illiterate person,
appears to be of the age of Henry VII., that is,
about the year 1500; but the composition (which he
has irremediably corrupted) is probably of an earlier
period, and much older, no doubt, than <i>The Play of
Robyn Hode</i>, which seems allusive to the same story."</p>

<p>Mr. Wright thinks the manuscript is proved to be of
the time of Henry VI. by a memorandum on one
page, setting forth the expenses of the feast on the
marriage of the king with Margaret:&mdash;"Thys ys exspences
of fflesche at the mariage of my ladey Marg'et,
that sche had owt off Eynglonde." But this memorandum
is more likely to apply to Margaret, daughter of
Henry VII., who was married "<i>out</i> of England," that
is, in Scotland, to James IV., than to the Margaret
who was married <i>in</i> England to Henry VI. (<i>Ed. Rev.</i>
lxxxvi. 126.)</p>

<p>The adventure in the first part of this story,&mdash;the
encounter between Robin Hood and a sturdy fellow
who proves his match or his superior&mdash;forms the subject
of a large number of this circle of ballads, the
antagonist being in one case a beggar, in another a
tanner, a tinker, the pinder of Wakefield, &amp;c. (See
the preface to <i>Robin Hood and the Beggar</i>, p. 188.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
The story of the second part is found again in <i>Robin
Hood and the Butcher</i>, and, with considerable differences,
in the third fit of the <i>Lytell Geste</i>.</p>

<p>It is in the disguise of a potter that the Saxon Hereward
penetrates into the Norman court, and that
Eustace the Monk eludes the vengeance of the Count
of Boulogne. Eustace also drew his enemy into an
ambush by nearly the same stratagem which Robin
employs to entice the sheriff of Nottingham into the
forest. (See the romances abridged in Wright's <i>Essays</i>,
ii. 108, 133, 135, 184.)</p>

<h3><a name="ROBYN_AND_GANDELYN" id="ROBYN_AND_GANDELYN"></a>ROBYN AND GANDELYN.</h3>


<p>This interesting ballad (derived from a manuscript
of the 15th century,) belongs to the cycle of Robin
Hood, as Mr. Wright remarks, "at least by its subject,
if not by the person whose death it celebrates."
It was first printed by Ritson in his <i>Ancient Songs
and Ballads</i>, (i. 81,) and has been again printed by
Mr. Wright in a little black-letter volume of <i>Songs
and Carols</i> (No. X); from which we take our copy.</p>

<p>The similarity of the name Gandelyn to the Gamelyn
of the <i>Cook's Tale</i>, attributed to Chaucer, and the
affinity of that story to the Robin Hood ballads, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
alluded to by the last-named editor. Is it not possible
that this name reappears again in the "Young Gamwell"
of <i>Robin Hood and the Stranger</i>?</p>

<p>The dialect of this piece is proved by an incidental
coincidence, says Mr. Wright, to be that of Warwickshire.</p>

<h3><a name="A_LYTELL_GESTE_OF_ROBYN_HODE" id="A_LYTELL_GESTE_OF_ROBYN_HODE"></a>A LYTELL GESTE OF ROBYN HODE.</h3>


<p>Three complete editions of this highly popular
poem are known, all without date. The earliest,
(perhaps not later than 1520,) is by Wynken de
Worde, and has this title: <i>Here beginneth a mery
geste of Robyn Hode and his meyne, and of the proude
sheryfe of Notyngham</i>. A second is by William Copland,
and is apparently made from the former. A
third was printed from Copland's, for Edward White,
and though without date is entered in the Stationers'
Registers in 1594. Portions have been preserved of
two other editions, earlier than any of these three.
Ritson had in his hands a few leaves of an "old
4to. black-letter impression," by Wynken de Worde,
"probably in 1489." <i>The Gest of Robyn Hode</i> was
also printed at Edinburgh, in 1508, by Chepman and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Myllar, who in the same year issued a considerable
number of poetical tracts. A volume of these, containing
a large fragment of the piece in question, was
most fortunately recovered towards the end of the last
century, and has been reprinted in fac simile by the
Messrs. Laing, Edinburgh, 1827.</p>

<p>The <i>Lytell Geste</i> is obviously to be regarded as an
heroic poem, constructed, partly or entirely, out of
previously existing unconnected "rhymes of Robin
Hood." The earlier ballads employed for this purpose
have not been handed down to us in their primitive
form. Whatever this may have been, they were
probably very freely treated by the rhapsodist that
strung them together, who has indeed retold the
ancient stories with such skill as might well cause
the ruder originals to be forgotten. Nevertheless, the
third fit of our little epic is indisputably of common
derivation with the last part of the older ballad of
<i>Robin Hood and the Potter</i>, and other portions of this
tale occur separately in ballads, which, though modern
in their structure, may have had a source independent
of the <i>Lytell Geste</i>.</p>

<p>It will be observed that each fit of this piece does
not constitute a complete story. Mr. Hunter has correctly
enough indicated the division into ballads as
follows: The first ballad is comprised in the first two
fits, and may be called Robin Hood and the Knight;
the second ballad is the third fit, and may be called
Little John and the Sheriff of Nottinghamshire; in
the fourth fit we have the ballad of Robin Hood
and the Monks of St. Mary; in the fifth and sixth,
Robin Hood, the Sheriff of Nottingham, and the
Knight; the seventh and part of the eighth contain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the ballad of Robin Hood and the King; and the
remaining stanzas of the eighth the Death of Robin
Hood.</p>

<p>Concerning the imagined historical foundation of
the <i>Lytell Geste</i>, see the general remarks on Robin
Hood prefixed to this volume.</p>

<p><a name="Linenote_4_9" id="Linenote_4_9"></a><a href="#LNanchor_4_9" title="link to line number">9</a> Barnsdale is a tract of country, four or five miles broad,
in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It was, we are told, woodland
until recent inclosures, and is spoken of by Leland as a
"woody and famous forest" in the reign of Henry the
Eighth. From the depths of this retreat to Doncaster the
distance is less than ten miles, and to Nottingham, in a
straight line, about fifty. A little to the north of Barnsdale
is Pontefract, and a little to the northwest is Wakefield, and
beyond this the Priory of Kirklees. Mr. Hunter, whom we
follow here, has shown by contemporary evidence that Barnsdale
was infested by robbers in the days of the Edwards.
"In the last year of the reign of King Edward the First, the
bishops of St. Andrew's and Glasgow, and the Abbot of
Scone were conveyed, at the King's charge, from Scotland
to Winchester. In this journey they had a guard, sometimes
of eight archers, sometimes of twelve; but when they had
got as far south as Daventry, they had no archers at all in
attendance, and proceeded without a guard, in three days
from thence to Winchester. But when they passed from
Pontefract to Tickhill, the guard had been increased to the
number of twenty archers, and the reason given in the account
of the expenses of their journey, for this addition to
the cost of the conveyance, is given in the two words, <i>propter
Barnsdale</i>."</p>

certain that there was formerly a place of the name in Barnsdale
or near it. "It was a very small tenancy of the manor
of Pontefract, being not more than the tenth of a knight's
fee" (Hunter). Watling Street stands here for the great
North Road, probably a Roman highway, which crosses

<h3><a name="ADAM_BEL_CLYM_OF_THE_CLOUGHE" id="ADAM_BEL_CLYM_OF_THE_CLOUGHE"></a>ADAM BEL, CLYM OF THE CLOUGHE,
AND WYLLYAM OF CLOUDESLÈ.</h3>


<p>This favorite and delightful ballad was printed by
William Copland, without date, but probably not far
from 1550. Only a single copy of this edition is
known to be preserved. There is another edition by
James Roberts, printed in 1605, with a second part
entitled <i>Young Cloudeslee</i>, "a very inferior and servile
production," says Ritson. Mr. Payne Collier has recently
recovered a fragment of an excellent edition
considerably older than Copland's.</p>

<p><i>Adam Bell, &amp;c.</i>, was also entered at Stationers' Hall
in 1557-8, as licensed to John King. Another entry
occurs in the same registers under 1582, and in 1586
mention is made of "A ballad of Willm. Clowdisley
never printed before." No one of these three impressions
is known to be extant.</p>

<p>Percy inserted this piece in his <i>Reliques</i>, (i. 158,)
following Copland's edition, with corrections from his
folio manuscript. Ritson adhered to Copland's text
with his usual fidelity, (<i>Pieces of Popular Poetry</i>,
p. 1.) We have printed the ballad from Ritson, with
some important improvements derived from a transcript
of Mr. Collier's fragment most kindly furnished by
that gentleman. This fragment extends from the 7th
verse of the second fit to the 55th of the third, but is
somewhat mutilated.</p>

<p>"Allane Bell" is mentioned by Dunbar in company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>with Robin Hood, Guy of Gisborne, and others. The
editor of the <i>Reliques</i> has pointed out several allusions
to the ballad in our dramatic poets, which show the
extreme popularity of the story. "Shakespeare, in
his comedy of <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>, act i. makes
Benedick confirm his resolves of not yielding to love,
by this protestation: 'If I do, hang me in a bottle
like a cat, and shoot at me, and he that hits me, let
him be clapt on the shoulder, and called Adam:'&mdash;meaning
Adam Bell, as Theobald rightly observes,
who refers to one or two other passages in our old
poets, wherein he is mentioned. The Oxford editor
has also well conjectured, that 'Abraham Cupid,'in
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, act ii. sc. 1, should be 'Adam Cupid,'
in allusion to our archer. Ben Jonson has mentioned
Clym o' the Clough in his <i>Alchemist</i>, act i. sc. 2. And
Sir William Davenant, in a mock poem of his, called
<i>The Long Vacation in London</i>, describes the attorneys
and proctors as making matches to meet in Finsbury
Fields.</p>

<p>The place of residence ascribed in the present ballad
to these outlaws is Englewood or Inglewood, a forest
in Cumberland sixteen miles in length, and extending
from Carlisle to Penrith, which, according to Wyntown,
was also frequented by Robin Hood, (<i>Cronykil</i>, vii.
10, 431.) By the author of the ballad of <i>Robin Hood's
Birth, Breeding, Valour, and Marriage</i>, they are made
contemporary with Robin Hood's father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>A state paper cited by Mr. Hunter exhibits a person
of the name of Adam Bell in connection with another
of Robin Hood's haunts, and is thought by that gentleman
to afford a clue to the real history of one of the
actors in the story.</p>

<p>"King Henry the Fourth, by letters enrolled in the
Exchequer, in Trinity Term, in the seventh year of
his reign [1406], and bearing date the 14th day of
April, granted to one Adam Bell an annuity of 4<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>
issuing out of the fee-farm of Clipston, in the forest of
Sherwood, together with the profits and advantages
of the vesture and herbage of the garden called the
Halgarth, in which the manor-house of Clipston is
situated.</p>

<p>"Now, as Sherwood is noted for its connection with
archery, and may be regarded also as the <i>patria</i> of
much of the ballad poetry of England, and the name
of Adam Bell is a peculiar one, this might be almost
of itself sufficient to show that the ballad had a
foundation in veritable history. But we further find
that this Adam Bell violated his allegiance by adhering
to the Scots, the King's enemies; whereupon
this grant was virtually resumed, and the sheriff of
Nottinghamshire accounted for the rents which would
have been his. In the third year of King Henry the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Fifth [1416], the account was rendered by Thomas
Hercy, and in the fourth year by Simon Leak. The
mention of his adhesion to the Scots, leads us to the
Scottish border, and will not leave a doubt in the mind
of the most sceptical (!) that we have here one of the
persons, some of whose deeds (with some poetical
license, perhaps) are come down to us in the words of
one of our popular ballads." <i>New Illustrations of the
Life, Studies, and Writings of Shakespeare</i>, i. 245.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Mr. Hunter is easily satisfied.
The Bells were one of the most notorious of the
marauding tribes of the Marches, and as late as 1593,
are grouped with the Graemes and Armstrongs, in a
memorial of the English Warden, as among "the bad
and more vagrant of the great surnames of the
border." (Rymer's <i>F&#339;dera</i>, xvi. 183, 2d ed.) Adam
was a very common <i>pr&#339;nomen</i> among these people,
and is borne by two other familiar ballad heroes, Adam
Gordon and Adam Car. The combination of Adam
Bell must have been anything but a rarity;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> nor
could it have been an unfrequent occurrence, for a
Scottish freebooter who had entered into the pay of
the English King, to return to his natural connections,
when a tempting opportunity offered itself, or for any
Border mercenary to change sides as often as this
seemed to be for his interest.</p>

<p>The rescue of William of Cloudesly by Adam Bell
and Clym of the Clough, in the second fit, resembles
in all the main points the rescue of Robin Hood by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Little John and Much, in <i>Robin Hood and the Monk</i>.
<a name="shot_at_the_apple" id="shot_at_the_apple"></a>The incident of the shot at the apple, in the third fit,
for a long time received as a part of the genuine history
of William Tell, is of great antiquity, and may be
traced northward from Switzerland through the various
Gothic nations to the mythical legends of Scandinavia.
The exploit is first narrated in the <i>Wilkina Saga</i> of
the archer Eigill, who, at Nidung's command, proves
his skill at the bow by shooting an apple from his
son's head. Eigill had selected three arrows, and on
being questioned as to the purpose of the other two,
replied that they were destined for Nidung in case the
first had caused the death of his child. This form of
the legend is of the 10th or 11th century. In the
12th century, Saxo Grammaticus tells this story of
Toko and King Harald. The resemblance to Tell is
in Toko's case stronger than in any; for, besides
making the same speech about the reserved arrow, he
distinguishes himself in a sea-storm, and shoots the
king,&mdash;this last feat being historical, and dated 992.
Similar achievements are ascribed in Norwegian sagas
to St. Olaf (died, 1030), and to King Haraldr Sigurtharson
(died, 1066), and in Schleswig Holstein, to
Heming Wolf, who having, in 1472, been outlawed for
taking part with a rebel against King Christian, and
falling into the hands of his enemies, was obliged to
exhibit his skill at the risk of his son's life. Again, in
Sprenger's <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i>, a work of the 15th
century, the story is related of one Puncher, a magician
of the Rhine country; and finally, about two
hundred years after the formation of the Swiss confederacy,
this famous exploit is imputed to Tell,
though early chroniclers have not a word to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
either about him or his archery. (See Grimm's<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
<i>Deutsche Mythologie</i>, ed. 1842, pp. 353-5, p. 1214:
Nork's <i>Mythologie der Volkssagen</i>, in Scheible's <i>Kloster</i>,
vol. 9, p. 105, <i>seqq.</i> Many of the documents that
bear upon this question are cited at length in Ideler's
<i>Schuss des Tell</i>, Berlin, 1836.)</p>

being offered for that purpose by his mother; and also
mentions a manuscript he had seen of travels in Turkey,
which contained a picture of a man shooting at an apple
placed on a child's head.</p></div>

<p>This ballad was derived from the Percy Manuscript,
and is printed in the <i>Reliques</i>, i. 84 (ed. 1794), with
some alterations by the Editor.</p>

<p>"As for Guy of Gisborne," says Ritson, "the only
further memorial which has occurred concerning him
is in an old satirical piece by William Dunbar, a celebrated
Scottish poet of the fifteenth century, on one
"Schir Thomas Nory," (MS. Maitland, p. 3, MMS.
More, Ll. 5, 10,) where he is named along with our
hero, Adam Bell, and other worthies, it is conjectured
of a similar stamp, but whose merits have not, less
fortunately, come to the knowledge of posterity.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, iii. 208.</p>


<p>This legend and the preceding are placed in this
volume solely on account of the names given to the
personages who figure in them. In character they
have no affinity with the recognized circle of Robin
Hood ballads. The story is of a more ancient cast,
and also of a type common to the northern nations,
and we have no doubt that Robin Hood and Little
John were in the day of their popularity made to displace
heroes of immemorial prescription, in order to
give eclat to an old tale.</p>

<p>Of <i>Rose the Red, and White Lilly</i>, three versions
have been published. The present is that of Scott,
given "chiefly" from Mrs. Brown's manuscript. Kinloch's
is subjoined, and another, furnished by Buchan,
is printed in the Appendix.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Robin Hood and his fellow, Little John," says
Motherwell, "were popular with the minstrels of Scotland
as they were with those of England. Our early
poets and historians never tired of alluding to songs
current in their own times, relative to these waithmen
and their merry men. Even to this day there are
fragments of songs regarding them, traditionally extant
in Scotland, which have not yet found their way
into any printed collection of ballads commemorative
of these celebrated outlaws. Were they carefully
gathered they would form an interesting addition to
Ritson's <i>Robin Hood</i>. In that collection, the ballad
of <i>Robin Hood and the Beggar</i> is evidently the production
of a Scottish minstrel, pretty early stall copies
of which were printed both at Aberdeen and Glasgow."&mdash;<i>Minstrelsy</i>,
p. xliii.</p>

<p>Ritson printed this ballad (<i>Robin Hood</i>, ii. 97,) from
a modern copy printed at Newcastle. He remarks
that a similar story may be found in <i>Le Moyen de parvenir</i>,
(i. 304, ed. 1739, <i>Comment un moine se débarasse
des voleurs</i>.)</p>

<p>We have adopted a superior version given by Gutch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
which was from an Aberdeen copy in the Ashmolean
Museum, without date.&mdash;(Gutch's <i>Robin Hood</i>, ii. 233.)</p>

<p><i>Robin Hood and the Beggar</i>, with the nine pieces
which are now immediately subjoined, the first part of
the tenth, (which has the same title as the present,) and
the first part of <a href="#ROBIN_HOOD_AND_THE_STRANGER"><i>Robin Hood and the Stranger</i>, in the
Appendix</a>, contains a story essentially the same with
the first part of the ancient ballad of <a href="#ROBIN_HOOD_AND_THE_POTTER"><i>Robin Hood and
the Potter</i></a>, p. <a href="#Page_17">17</a>.</p>

<p class="center">Ritson's <i>Robin Hood</i>, ii. 155.</p>


<p>"This ballad," says Ritson, "from the York edition
of <i>Robin Hood's Garland</i>,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> is probably one of the
oldest extant of which he is the subject. The circumstance
of Robin's changing clothes with the palmer,
is, possibly, taken from an old romance, entitled <i>The
noble hystory of the moost excellent and myghty prynce
and hygh renowmed knyght kynge Ponthus of Galyce
and of lytell Brytayne</i>. Emprynted at London in
Fletestrete, at the sygne of the sonne, by Wynken
de Worde. In the yere of our lorde god 1511, 4to.
bl. sig, <span class="smcap">L</span> 6. 'And as he (Ponthus) rode, he met
with a poore palmer, beggynge his brede, the whiche
had his gowne all to-clouted and an olde pylled
hatte: so he alyght, and sayd to the palmer, frende,
we shall make a chaunge of all our garmentes, for ye
shall have my gowne and I shall have yours and your
hatte. A, syr, sayd the palmer, ye bourde you with
me. In good fayth, sayd Ponthus, I do not; so he
dyspoyled hym and cladde hym with all his rayment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
and he put upon hym the poore mannes gowne, his
gyrdell, his hosyn, his shone, his hatte and his bourden.'"</p>

<p>"There is an allusion to this ballad," adds Gutch,
"in Anthony Munday's play of <i>The Downfall of Robert
Earl of Huntington</i>. Collier's <i>Old Plays</i>, p. 41."</p>

for the archery practised there. "In the year 1498," says
Stow, "all the gardens which had continued time out of

lordship of Fensberry, were destroyed. And of them was
made a plaine field for archers to shoote in." <i>Survay of
London</i>, 1598, p. 351. See also p. 77, where it is observed
that "about the feast of S. Bartlemew ... the officers of
the city ... were challengers of all men in the suburbes, ...
before the lord maior, aldermen, and sheriffes, in <span class="smcap">Fensbery
fielde</span>, to shoote the standarde, broade arrow, and flight, for
games."</p>

<p>[The Finsbury] archers are mentioned by Ben Jonson,
in <i>Every man in his humour</i>, act i, scene 1: "Because
I dwell at Hogsden, I shall keep company with none but the
archers of Finsbury."</p>

<p>The practice of shooting here is alluded to by Cotton, in
his <i>Virgile travestie</i> (b. iv.), 1667:</p>

<p class="center">Ritson's <i>Robin Hood</i>, ii. 1.</p>


<p>Ritson printed this piece from a black-letter copy
in a large and valuable collection of old ballads which
successively belonged to Major Pearson, the Duke
of Roxburghe, and Mr. Bright, but which is now in
the British Museum.</p>

<p>The full title of the original is: <i>A new ballad of bold
Robin Hood; shewing his birth, breeding, valour, and
marriage at Tilbury Bull-running. Calculated for the
meridian of Staffordshire, but may serve for Derbyshire
or Kent</i>.</p>

place lies about four miles from Burton-upon-Trent,
on the west bank of the river Don. Its castle, it is supposed,
was built a considerable time before the Norman conquest.
Being the principal seat of the Dukes of Lancaster, it was
long distinguished as the scene of festivity and splendour.
The number of minstrels which crowded it was so great,
that it was found necessary to have recourse to some expedient
for preserving order among them, and determining their
claims of precedence. Accordingly, one of their number,
with the title of king of the minstrels, was appointed, and
under him several inferior officers, to assist in the execution
of the laws. To this chief a charter was granted by John
of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, 22nd August, 4th Richard II.,
1381. This king of the minstrels and his officers having
inflicted fines and punishments which exceeded the due
bounds of justice, a court for hearing and determining complaints
and controversies was instituted, which was yearly
held with many forms and ceremonies. The business of the
court being concluded, the officers withdraw to partake of a
sumptuous repast, prepared for them by the steward of the
lordship. In the afternoon the minstrels assembled at the
gate of the priory, where, by way of amusement for the multitude,
a bull, having his horns, ears, and tail cut off, his body
besmeared with soap, and his nose blown full of pepper, was
then let loose. If the minstrels could take and hold him,
even so long as to deprive him of the smallest portion of his
hair, he was declared their property, provided this was done
within the confines of Staffordshire, and before sunset. The
bull was next collared and roped, and being brought to the
market cross, was baited with dogs. After this he was delivered
to the minstrels, who might dispose of him as they
deemed proper. <i>Vide</i> Blount's <i>Ancient Tenures</i>, Hawkins's

<h3><a name="A_TRUE_TALE_OF_ROBIN_HOOD" id="A_TRUE_TALE_OF_ROBIN_HOOD"></a>A TRUE TALE OF ROBIN HOOD.</h3>

<p class="center">Gutch's <i>Robin Hood</i>, ii. 88.</p>


<p>This doggerel is by Martin Parker, a well-known
author of ballads in the reign of Charles I. and during
the Protectorate. The titles of several of his works
are given by Ritson, (<i>Robin Hood</i>, i. 127,) and those
of others may be seen in Collier's <i>Roxburghe Ballads</i>,
237, 243, and Ritson's <i>Ancient Songs</i>, ii. 257, 263;
among these last is the celebrated song, <i>When the
king enjoys his own again</i>.</p>

<p>Ritson printed this piece from a black-letter edition dated 1686. Gutch
obtained a somewhat better copy from Mr. Collier, which we have here
followed. "The date of Mr. Collier's copy is cut off, but enough remains
to shew that it was printed at London, 'for T. Cotes, and are to be sold
by F. Grove, dwelling upon Snow-hill near the Saracens * * *.' The first
edition was entered at Stationers' Hall, 20th February, 1631."</p>

<blockquote><p>The title in full is: "<i>A True Tale of Robbin Hood,
Or, a brief touch of the life and death of that renowned
outlaw, Robert, Earle of Huntington, vulgarly
called Robbin Hood, who lived and died in
1198, being the 9th yeare of king Richard the first,
commonly called Richard Cuer de Lyon; carefully
collected out of the truest writers of our English</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
<i>Chronicles and published for the satisfaction of those
who desire to see truth purged from falsehood</i>. <span class="smcap">By
Martin Parker.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>At the end of the tale is the following epitaph,
"which the prioresse of the monastery of Kirkes Lay
in Yorkshire set over Robbin Hood, which was to
bee reade within these hundreth yeares (though in
old broken English), much to the same sence and
meaning."</p>

<h3><a name="THE_PLAYE_OF_ROBYN_HODE" id="THE_PLAYE_OF_ROBYN_HODE"></a>THE PLAYE OF ROBYN HODE.</h3>

<p>From Ritson's <i>Robin Hood</i>, ii. 192.</p>


<p>Printed by Copland at the end of his edition of
the <i>Lytell Geste</i>. The whole title runs: <i>Here beginnethe
the playe of Robyn Hoode, very proper to be
played in Maye games</i>. A few corrections were made
by Ritson from White's edition of 1634.</p>

<p>The fragment here preserved is founded upon the
ballads of <i>Robin Hood and the Curtall Fryer</i>, (p. 271,)
and <i>Robin Hood and the Potter</i> (p. 17.) Were the
whole play recovered, we should probably find it a
<i>pot pourri</i> of the most favorite stories of Robin Hood.</p>

<h3><a name="FRAGMENT_OF_AN_INTERLUDE_OF" id="FRAGMENT_OF_AN_INTERLUDE_OF"></a>FRAGMENT OF AN INTERLUDE (?)   OF
ROBIN HOOD.</h3>


<p>The lines which follow would seem to be part of
an Interlude, in which, as in the play just given, the
incidents of several ballads are rudely combined.
The present fragment is manifestly founded on <i>Robin
Hood and Guy of Gisborne</i>. We owe this curious
relic to a correspondent of <i>Notes and Queries</i> (vol. xii.
p. 321), who found it in an interleaved copy of <i>Robin
Hood's Garland</i>, formerly belonging to Dr. Stukely,
the inventor of the preposterous pedigree of Robin
Hood.   The Doctor has prefixed these remarks:&mdash;"It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
is not to be doubted but that many of subsequent
songs are compiled from old ballads wrote in the time,
or soon after Robin Hood, with alterations from time
to time into the more modern language. Mr. Le
Neve (Norroy) has a large half-sheet of paper which
was taken from the inside of some old book, which
preserves in an old hand a fragment of this sort. On
the back of it is wrote, among other accounts, this,
'It<sup>m</sup>, R. S. of Richard Whitway, penter for his house,
sent in full payment, jx. <i>s.</i>, the vij. day of November,
Edw'<sup>d</sup> iij. xv.'; and in a later hand as follows."</p>

<h3><a name="THE_SONG_OF_ROBIN_HOOD_AND_HIS" id="THE_SONG_OF_ROBIN_HOOD_AND_HIS"></a>THE SONG OF ROBIN HOOD AND HIS
HUNTES-MEN.</h3>

<p>From Anthony Munday's London pageant for 1615,
entitled <i>Metropolis Coronata, the Triumphes of Ancient
Drapery</i>. Munday was a popular ballad-writer, and,
together with Chettle, the author of two well-known
plays on the fortunes of "Robert Earl of Huntington."
This song is taken from <i>The Civic Garland</i>, in the
Percy Society Publications, vol. xix. p. 15.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
